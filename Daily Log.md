# 100 Days Of Code - Log 

### Day 1: December 17, 2021
### The beginning 

**Today's Progress**: Setup GitHub, began to explore its functionalities and I worked on a four simple and basic C programs. 

**Thoughts:** Day 1 and the Journey has begun, let's see what's awaiting next.  

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: December 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with GeekforGeeks C course. working with variables, ranges of data types, basic mathematical calculations and a simple project of electrical engineering circuit.     

**Thoughts:** Day 2, it is getting very interesting and can't wait until I learn more!

### Day 3: December 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learning from GeeksforGeeks C course about global variables, static variables, constants and operator sizeof(). Did a simple program using printf(), scanf(), and calculations.    

**Thoughts:** Day 3, There is no way to go back.  

### Day 4: December 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned a bit about random number generator rand() and seed the rand srand(); continuing learning about static variables and literals. Finally, I implemented a loop for a simple guess game I wanted to code.  

**Thoughts:** Day 4, learning the fundamentals while having fun combining the basics.  

## Day 5: December 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Following GeeksforGeeks C programming course I learned more about literals, character and string literals, and type conversion. I wrote a very short and simple program that compute the resonance frequency of a series RLC circuit given the user's input.    

**Thoughts:** Day 5  When I seat down to code, time flies. Having fun!
